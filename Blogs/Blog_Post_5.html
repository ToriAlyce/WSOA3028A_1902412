            <h3>Google bombing?</h3>
            <p>
                Google bombing is when a key word search is linked to a certain webpage or piece of information on the web.  
                This is caused when the author of a webpage creates a hyperlink with an anchored text containing a key word 
                or phrase. Therefore, whenever someone searches this word or phrase the webpage linked to it will appear. 
                This is done by people manipulating the google algorithm, as large numbers of individuals creating these links 
                google then began to associate these pages to a specific key word or phrase. This however has quite negative 
                effects, an example being in 2007 if someone googled “failure” or “miserable failure,” the biography of George W. Bush 
                would be the first result to show up. However, these words were not contained in the biography but due to individuals 
                creating the links to theses sites using the key word or phrase, they were able to manipulate googles search engine 
                so that when someone searches “Liar” that George W. Bush biography will appear. This is Google Bombing and since Google 
                was suspectable to this there was a call that Google change their algorithms to prevent this happening. However, google 
                only made slight adjustments that were able to reduce Google Bombing but not completely prevent it. 
                What is interesting is that Google Bombing has created a whole industry around people trying to manipulate the search 
                engine in order to get more viewers on the webpages and increase their rankings. Bloggers will change their writing 
                style to attract more hyperlinks to their page. This overall can create issues that when searching people do not get 
                exactly what they are looking for due to this type of manipulation. That is why google is increasingly trying to combat 
                people’s manipulation of the Google algorithm.

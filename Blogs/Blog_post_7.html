                designed to do tasks that if done manually would take up a lot of time. Therefore, it is good to decide what type 
                of task the bot can do that will save a lot of time for the web designer. 
                Next needs to be the sets of steps that the bot would need to take in order to complete the tasks, this needs to 
                be very carefully planned so that the bot is able to function properly. The bot designer must also check if these 
                steps can be done automatically by the bot itself or if there needs to be some manual help for the bot. 
                The language the bot is designed in then needs to be carefully chosen, so that it best suits the bots chosen function.
                 As well If the bot can be run as a stand-alone program or is it going to be running within the web browser. 
                 And if the bot must run on a remote server check if other editors are able to operate it. 
                All these are essential considerations to take before you design your bot that well help the bot run efficient and 
                error free.

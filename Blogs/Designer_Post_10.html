        <h3>Geographies of Participation.</h3>
        <Section>
            <p>
                When reading Graham et al’s studies towards information geographies, the discussion I was most interested in was the 
                Geographies of Participation. This part of the reading discusses the various types of contributions different countries 
                around the world are making towards the web. This was discussed in terms the geography of domain names, distributors of 
                collaborative coding and Geographies of Wikipedia contributions. As all these aspects build communities and show what type 
                of information the various countries are participating in on the internet. What made me interested in this section of the 
                reading is the fact that us learning web design allows us to become better contributors to all these aspects as well. 
                Allowing South Africa to grow its number of contributors across all platforms and increase our participation in internet 
                geographies. 
                <blockquote>
                    “By analysing and comparing three important (yet different) indicators of content creation on the web, we are 
                    able to highlight possible common patterns in participation while also highlighting the ways that difference in platform 
                    and purpose shape user involvement.”[1]
                </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of this reading is to highlight the different aspects as to what countries are contributing to the content 
                on the internet, and the geography of domain names allow us to see that information. Domain names are used as they 
                contribute to building up the information and media on the web. Domain names provide a proxy stating where the information 
                of the content in coming from geographically. This also allows us to see which countries are contributing to creating the 
                content of the internet and which are consuming the content. The Figure 1 below shows the distribution of the two types of 
                domain names: Firstly (gTLDs) Generic Top- Level Domains. These are domains using the .com or .org. The second being (ccTLDs) 
                or Top Level Domains which associate with the countries the domains are created in. Such as .de for Germany and .ke for Kenya. 
                Figure 1 below shows the countries as how they are contributing towards the internet. The size of the circles represents the 
                amount of domain names being created in that country, whereas the darker the colour represents a higher amount of internet 
                users in the country.

                <blockquote>
                    “A key take-away from this geography of content production is that large internet populations do not automatically 
                    translate into larger number of domain registrations”[1]
                </blockquote>
                Therefore, there is a large difference between the access of internet information that countries have and their 
                contributions towards participating in content creation.
            </p>
            <p>
                This section of the reading is interesting as it does give a very clear idea of which countries are participating or 
                consuming the content on the internet. I do, however, find it problematic as it does not consider other aspects as 
                to why some countries do not participate in content creation. It fails to consider that each country has different 
                economy’s, populations and struggles that they are faced with. Such as some countries have high poverty rates and not 
                every person has access to computers or cell phones as main concerns is trying to provide for their family. Therefor it 
                is unfair to say that for example, the US is a fair more active in content creation compared to South Africa. As each 
                country has access to different types of resources allowing them to be able to contribute more into these factors. 
                Compared to a country that does not have the same about of resources available to them.

                Next is the distributors of collaborative coding, this focuses on the contribution of countries towards distributing and 
                creating content on GitHub. 
                <blockquote>
                    “no other coding hosting service has remotely the same number of users, making GitHub a useful proxy for the extent 
                    to which internet users create and share code.”[1]
                </blockquote>
                On Git Hub users are able to collaborate with each other, share code and content with each other. That is way it is fair 
                to consider GitHub as it does supply relevant information in terms of who is participating in collaborative coding in 
                various countries. These types of contributions can be more significant as it is not focusing on small aspects of websites 
                and domain name but of software which provides foundation of creating content on the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, back to my pervious argument in terms the reasons as to why some countries do not participate in content creation. 
                Still due to lack of resources and accessibility available. It is difficult to state that a country is not contributing 
                just based of the numbers and not taking into consideration the different types of resources that are alliable in each 
                country. Not every country has the luxury to educate vast amounts of the population on how to do website design, create 
                repositories etc. Therefore, these aspects focused on in the reading more so highlight the areas in which countries can 
                try work on in terms of creating more content locally. Aspects that they can try work towards allowing for better resources 
                and accessibility to all countries globally. 
            </p>

                Lastly are the Geographies of Wikipedia contributions. Wikipedia is the largest and most used encyclopaedia, whereby 
                anyone can edit and contribute information and is accessed by majority of internet users around the world. So, Wikipedia 
                as the ability to influence thousands of viewers with the information it makes available. Therefore, it is fair to 
                consider the contribution towards Wikipedia it is easily assessable only with the need of internet connection so there 
                is a wonder as to why various countries are not contributing to the content of Wikipedia.
                <blockquote>
                    “Wikipedia’s approach to contributions, in theory, allows anyone with an internet connection to contribute 
                    (The platforms strapline is ‘the free encyclopaedia that anyone can edit’).”[1]
                </blockquote>
                One of the reasons I believe that there is not as much contribution towards Wikipedia could be because people do not 
                know how valuable their contributions are, and why they should produce content. It can be fair to say that the population 
                is not aware of why they need to get more involved. Therefore, I do believe that making this knowledge more open to the 
                public will change the number of contributors drastically. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, I do believe that this reading allows an insight on how different countries are contributing towards the 
                internet in many ways. It is important to consider and allows us to be able to change, aspects that can allow our 
                country to participate more in the content creation and be aware of how valuable their contribution is. However, I 
                do believe that this way of looking at the participation of content creation is heavily focused on a certain type 
                of content. That it does not focus on the other platforms that are made available and heavily used across countries. 
                Such as participation in content creation on social media. As social media platforms are heavily used by the public 
                across the world. Therefore, this reading only provides incite on certain aspects of how countries participate in 
                content creation. Not taking into account the content posted on social media as well as the disadvantages that different 
                countries face as to be the reason why their contribution is not so strong.

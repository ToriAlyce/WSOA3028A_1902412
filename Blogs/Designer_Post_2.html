        <h3>Semantics are the reason you can view this page!</h3>
        <p>
           So today we started learning about Semantic Mark Ups, and what these basically are, are the 
           key words used in HTML code in order to divide parts of a webpage into visible sections. 
           For example; you have Headers, body, navs and many others. These basically allow the web 
           developer to organize their code and divide it into many sections and improve 
           their structure overall. The reason that Semantic Mark Up is so important and must be used appropriately, is that 
           when a webpage is being worked on by a group of designers, everyone will understand 
           the structure and sectioning, and the workflow will go a lot smoother.

           So how this webpage works is that I have made use of Semantic Mark Up in order to design this 
           page, this also allows for my sectioning and everything to make more sense, so that if I need 
           to go back and change anything I will be able to fix certain aspects without influencing others.

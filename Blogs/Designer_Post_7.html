        <h3>What should be considered when making your own web bots?</h3>
        <p>
            Did you know you can make your own web Robot? 
            There is tons of information all over the internet that allow for people to create and make their own web robots. 
            Here is a link to Vivek Ratanâ€™s article on Web Robots: The worker bees of the internet - where there is also a 
            section teaching you how to make your very own web robot.

            But before that can even happen, there are a few things to be considered. 
            Firstly, what is the robots purpose going to be? What type of task is the robot going to perform? Web robots are 
            designed to do tasks that, if done manually, would take up a lot of time. Therefore, it is good to decide what type 
            of task the bot can do that will save a lot of time for the web designer. 
            Next, the set of steps that the bot would need to take in order to complete the tasks. This needs to 
            be very carefully planned so that the bot is able to function properly. The bot designer must also check if these 
            steps can be done automatically by the bot itself, or if there needs to be some manual help for the bot. 
            The language the bot is designed in then needs to be carefully chosen, so that it best suits the bot's chosen function.
            Considering if the bot can be run as a stand-alone program, or is it going to be running within the web browser. 
            And if the bot must run on a remote server, check if other editors are able to operate it. 
            All these are essential considerations to take before you design your bot that will help the bot run efficiently and 
            error free.

        <h3>URL's are like the little homes of the internt.</h3>
        <p>
           URL stands for Union Resource Locator. It is one of the most important components to the web as it allows you to be 
           able to use browsers to retrieve any resource published on to the web. A URL is basically a unique address given to 
           a type of resource on the web and can be used in order to find that exact resource. </br>
           For a URL to work properly for the associated webpage, it is composed of different parts. The main components being 
           the protocol, this is a method used by the browser to go through the data around a computer network.
           The domain name indicates the web server being requested. Then the port, this is the gate that accesses the resource. 
           The path to the file, is the path taken by the sever to get to that resource. Parameters are values set up by the 
           server, the server can use them to do extra stuff before returning to the resource. Lastly there is the Anchor this 
           is a type of “bookmark” used by the webpage to tell the server where a certain type of recourse is located. </br>
           URL’s are like the home addresses for resources on the web. “the protocol represents the postal service you want to 
           use, the domain name is the city or town, and the port is like the zip code; the path represents the building where 
           your mail should be delivered; the parameters represent extra information such as the number of the apartment in the 
           building; and, finally, the anchor represents the actual person to whom you've addressed your mail.” </br>
           What is interesting is that as a web designer, working in HTML in a certain way allows you to make use of the structure 
           of your URL. This can influence how the viewers, will interact with your webpage. In terms of how they are able to find 
           the exact resource they are looking for and based on the components of your webpage they interact with allows people 
           to be able to explore all the information you offer.

        <h3>So how does a browser work?</h3>
        <p>
           When a web user interacts with a browser, they expect fast connection as well as smooth interaction so that using the 
           browser isnâ€™t such a taxing task. As web developers we play a part in making the users interaction with webpages go 
           smoothly, this can be done by understanding the basic components that apply to the browser. </br>
           Number one is Navigation. This is the first step the user faces when assessing a browser. These things such as clicking 
           a link, entering a URL or looking up something. The goal as web designers is to make this Navigation step as short and 
           easy as possible. So that the user can find what resource they need in just a click, or maybe two.</br>
           Next is the response, once the server is connected, the browser will respond by sending an HTTP get request on behalf 
           of the user. Once the request is complete the server responds with the correct HTML page. This is the first byte of data 
           received by the browser and is known as Time to First Byte Data (TTFB). This is the time it takes from when the user made 
           the request by clicking a link and loading all the data on the page linked to it.</br>
           Last is Parsing after the browser receives it first incisal data it starts parsing. Parsing is when the browser turns the 
           data into DOM and CSSOM, that is then used by the renderer to load the page onto the screen for the user. The DOM is the 
           markup representation for the browser (going back to samantic markup). After this is done it moves to the CSSOM, this 
           accesses the styling aspects of the webpage that are going to be rendered for the viewer. </br>
           Understanding this allowed me to really understand how the webpage that I create is loaded by the browser. This is important 
           to know because as web designers we can make use of this information to help browsers load our data better making our webpages 
           assessable to the public and easy to interact with.

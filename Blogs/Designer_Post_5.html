        <h3>Google Bombing?</h3>
        <p>
            Google bombing is when a keyword search is linked to a certain webpage or piece of information on the web.  
            This is caused when the author of a webpage creates a hyperlink with an anchored text containing a key word 
            or phrase. Therefore, whenever someone searches this word or phrase the webpage linked to it will appear. 
            This is done by people manipulating the google algorithm. As large numbers of individuals create these links, 
            Google then began to associate these pages with a specific key word or phrase. This however has quite negative 
            effects. An example being that in 2007 if someone Googled “failure” or “miserable failure,” the biography of George W. Bush 
            would be the first result to show up. However, these words were not contained in the biography but due to individuals 
            creating the links to these sites using the key word or phrase, they were able to manipulate Google search engines
            so that when someone searched “failure” George W. Bush's Biography will appear.

            This is Google Bombing, and since Google was susceptable to this, there was a call that Google change their algorithms to 
            prevent this from happening. However, Google only made slight adjustments that were able to reduce Google Bombing, 
            but not completely prevent it. 
            What is interesting is that Google Bombing has created a whole industry around people trying to manipulate the search 
            engine, in order to get more viewers on their webpages and increase their rankings. Bloggers will change their writing 
            style to attract more hyperlinks to their page. Overall this can create issues, when searching people do not get 
            exactly what they are looking for due to this type of manipulation. That is why Google is increasingly trying to combat 
            people’s manipulation of the Google Algorithm.

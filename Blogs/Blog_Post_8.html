                The Gestyy virus is an unwanted app software similar to a browser add-on and is known to reroute the users to 
                advertising-heavy sites. Gestyy is also known to change the user’s settings without their permission and is known 
                as a browser hijacker. 
             </br>
                So, what about this virus? Well something I found interesting happened to my sister. The other day my sister was 
                complaining that during a zoom call her phone kept redirecting mid call to the Gestyy.com site. She got very 
                frustrated, so she tried to fix it herself.  In her google chrome settings she went under the “Site settings” and 
                went into “Java script” and under the “Blocked sites” section she added the Gestyy.com web address. She thought 
                she solved the problem and that she would no longer be redirected when just using her phone. However, the redirect 
                still popped up. Only this time there was no contents on the page, it was just a blank page that her phone kept being 
                redirected to.

             </br>
                This was very interesting for me as I assumed that by blocking the java script code what she essentially did was 
                block all the visual elements designed for the webpage. Therefore, the virus was still on her phone but due to her 
                blocking the java script, all the visual aspects of the webpage were not assessable anymore. Yet the HTML basis for
                the web page was still showing and that is why she was now getting a blank redirect instead.
             </br>
                So, in order to get rid of the virus she googled and came across the HowToRemove.Guide site that told her of all 
                the possible things she could do to try remove the virus. The first steps instructed were to clear all her browsing 
                data, cache and cookies on her browser. That didn’t seem to work, but it was also suggested that the virus could have 
                come from apps installed on her phone. Recently she had installed a violin tuning app, she uninstalled it and the 
                Gestyy virus was gone. 
             </br>
                After some research it is said that File-bundling is currently the most widespread distribution method for apps of 
                the browser hijacker type. File bundling is often used by app designers as it allows to group or bundle a whole lot 
                of files together in a compressed way, so the app takes up less data.
                Therefore, that was my interesting experience and my sisters very frustrating experience on the Gestyy virus.

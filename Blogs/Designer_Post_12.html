        <h3>Character Rationale</h3>
        <section>
            <p>
                In the beginning of this year when we where tasked to design our characters, I found it very difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were so many amazing characters I could do, and I got over excited and bit off more than I could 
                chew with my first characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, now I have made my final character. Charlette Salloue, a 24-year-old writer. The main reason 
                I chose to make my character a writer is that I did want to take writing this year but decided to take 
                animation instead. So, I am going to use my character to inspire me to get the best of both worlds and 
                be able to write story’s. However, this will not be any type of stories. I really want to try bringing 
                out how my character is truly South African, and is inspired by the country she lives in. I enjoy the 
                added challenge of this, as it allows me to look at the beautiful aspects that South Africa has to offer 
                and write about it as my character. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My character is very determined, and I want to also write about her challenges and experiences in being 
                a South African business owner. Yet she is a very pessimistic person, who try’s her best to be as positive 
                as she can. so, I thought I could enjoy from writing in her different perspectives. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I do believe I could add a lot more onto my character, and really try make her interesting. Hopefully, 
                I am able to do that.

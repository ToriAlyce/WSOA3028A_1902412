            <h3>Hi everyone!</h3>
            <p>Hi, and welcome to my blog! I’m an interactive media student 
                at WITS University. Here I’m going to be blogging about all 
                the interesting and new things I learn well learning web design. 
                So, get ready to read up on some of my challenges, code trials 
                and interesting things I’m going to be learning. I hope you find 
                them as interesting as I do!</p>

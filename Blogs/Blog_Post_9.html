            <h3>My website design</h3>
            <p>
                This is how I thought of designing my website layout.
 
                So, this was my rough wireframe, with this I kept it very simple, trying not to go into the finished design of my 
                website. So, this is how I want it to look before I do all the layout and final design. This is home or about page 
                design, showing the first page that the viewer will see. I created Nav links will take the viewer to the characters 
                and my blog posts. On the about page I also added the abouts of my blog page as well as the characters so the viewer 
                can have more of an idea of the content that each will include. 
            </br>
                Here is the rough design I did of my websiteâ€™s final layout. This is the idea I have of how the final website page 
                will look. The three main circles on the page will tell the viewer what page they are on. I want to try creating a 
                dull effect over the profile pictures, so when the viewer clicks onto the dull profile it will light up and the page 
                they were previously on, will go dull. If I am able to include this in the final design of my webpage, I think it will
                really allow the viewer to have some visual feedback from the website as to what page they are on and what they are 
                viewing.

        <h3>My website design.</h3>
        <p>
            This is how I thought of designing my website layout.

            So, this was my rough wireframe. With this I kept it very simple, trying not to go into the finished design of my 
            website. This is how I want it to look before I do all the layout and final design. This is the home or about page 
            design showing the first page that the viewer will see. I created Nav links that will take the viewer to the characters 
            and my blog posts. On the about page I also added the "abouts" of my blog page, as well as the characters, so that the viewer 
            can have more of an idea of the content that each will include. 
        </br>
        <p>

         </p>
        </br>
            Here is the rough design of my websiteâ€™s final layout. This is the idea I have of how the final website page 
            will look. The three main circles on the page will tell the viewer what page they are on. I want to try creating a 
            dull effect over the profile pictures, so when the viewer clicks onto the dull profile, it will light up and the page 
            they were previously on will go dull. If I am able to include this in the final design of my webpage, I think it will
            really allow the viewer to have some visual feedback from the website, as to what page they are on and what they are 
            viewing.

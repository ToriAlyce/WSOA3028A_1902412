                This week we looked at Shane Greenstein, Chris Forman, and Avi Goldfarb paper on “How Geography shapes and is shaped by 
                the internet”. An interesting paper that made me think of how the internet contributes to the world. 
                This reading discusses how the internet can reduce three economic frictions. Such as communication costs, search costs 
                and transportation costs and how the economic friction that is reduced varies in terms of different locations across the world.  
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of the communication costs the reading explains that communication costs can be inexpensive to use for people to 
                communicate across the globe. Meaning that people can interact and communicate no matter how far the distance is. However, 
                digital communication does not help in all aspects. Even though people are able to communicate across the globe without 
                needing to meet face to face. Some aspects of economic business require more personal interactions that digital. In terms 
                of establishing new partnerships. 
                <blockquote>
                    “For example, while information technology (IT) may be an effective means of coordinating ongoing projects and collaborations, 
                    it may be less effective as a means of establishing new partnerships or collaborative relationships.”
                </blockquote>
                Then there is transportation costs, this discusses how transportation costs are low on the internet and distribution can be free 
                for some aspects of digital media such as digital news, magazines etc... As well as limiting the travel for consumers by ordering 
                products online and them being delivered straight to their door.  
                <blockquote>
                    “Lower distribution costs online also enable a wider selection of products, particularly for geographically isolated customers. 
                    Online retailers have the potential to offer a much greater product selection than what can be carried by any physical store”
                </blockquote>
                And lastly is the reduction in search costs, this is influenced by both transportation and communication costs. Meaning if 
                transportation and communication costs fall then it is easier to compare choices before decisions need to be made. This 
                can be in terms of hiring or buying products. Then there is no need for physical searching of products as they are all 
                available over the internet and can be compared easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, these aspects are differently affected across the world. This ca be due to local preferences, the availability of 
                substitutes, and the availability of complements. In different parts of the world as it relies on the use of input from 
                communities, stores, and companies. Some areas of the world do not have the resources to go completely digital.
                <blockquote>
                    “That is because adoption of the Internet relies on complementary inputs such as broadband service or expertise in 
                    implementing IT systems, which varies across locations, creating variance in the net benefits to adoption. As a result, 
                    the diffusion of the Internet did not have the same impact on all locations.”
                </blockquote>
                Therefore, the use of the digital world being implemented geography can be vital to some parts of the world as it reduces the 
                communication, transportation, and search results. Yet other parts of the world may not find it as beneficial due to the amount 
                of input they could or could not provide for their location, to influence these factors. So how the geographies shape and are 
                shaped by the boils down to the amount that they can contribute to the digital platform.

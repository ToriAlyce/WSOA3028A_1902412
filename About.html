        <h2>So what is this all about?</h2>
            <p>
                So, this is a website I have made for my Interactive Media class.
            </p>
            <p>
                On this website I am going to be showing creative work in character development by blogging as my 
                created character, Charlette Salloue. She is an inspired 24-Year-old writer, who wants to get her 
                stories out into the world. As well as show her experience as life of a South African business owner, 
                as she is trying to bring back to life an old book shop she has inherited. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I will also be discussing more of the courses theory work, by blogging about this website, readings, 
                and interesting things we learn in this class. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Hope you enjoy my first website!

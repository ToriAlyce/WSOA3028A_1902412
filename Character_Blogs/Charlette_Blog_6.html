             <h3>Garbage Man</h3>
             <section>

                5 am, the sun nearly visible in the sky, they all sang and whistled in the cool morning air on the back of an obnoxiously 
                loud truck. The air around the truck stank, but he didn’t mind. He always knew how to smile and make the best of whatever 
                moment he was in. They jumped off and grabbed the dustbins hooking them to the back of the crane and watched as the truck 
                heaved them upside down, emptying all the contents, old meat, brown egg shells, various obscenities, and what looked like 
                some rotten minced meat all dropped into the back of the truck. No matter how many times he has seen that stinking old 
                truck heave the dustbins, he still couldn’t help and stare as how easily it lifted everything. 
               </p>
               <p>
                Attaching the next set of dustbins to the crane, he noticed something unusual being throw in with the sludge. He climbed 
                up the side of the truck to investigate. To his surprise, lying in the mess of what can only be described as garbage, lay 
                a teddy bear. Bits of old spinach clung to his fur. He reached in and recued the toy to take a closer look, peeling the 
                sticking spinach leaves from the fur. It was a pretty old teddy bear, only having one ear and some stuffing pouring from 
                his right foot. All it needed was a little bit of a clean up and it would be good as new. His heart soared as he thought 
                of his little sister. She would always wake up at the crack of dawn to see him off before he went to work. She was a 
                morning person so he always started off his day with a laugh as she trudged into the kitchen, her hair sticking up in 
                almost every direction. Thanks to her, his days were always started with a laugh and a smile, and now he could give her 
                something that could make her smile just as much. He wrapped the bear in his jacket and put it in the front with the driver. 
                He would ask his mother to help him fix it a bit before he gave it to her. He knew she would love it, I guess you could say 
                one man’s trash is another man’s treasure. Skipping to catch up with the garbage truck moving up to the next few houses, he 
                grabbed onto one of the side handles, grinning with excitement. He could not wait to see her face when he gives it to her.

                His body jolted him awake, it was early morning and he could hear the cars rushing outside on their way to work. 
                Reaching over he stretched for Timothy, his teddy bear that he slept with every night for as long as he could remember. 
                Timothy always managed to get pushed around and he found him the most random parts of his bed. He always had to look for 
                him every morning. He felt to his left and right. The bear was not there. He sat up, looked around, and jumped out of bed 
                pulling out his blankets. Still he could not find Timothy. It normally didn’t take this long to find him. His heart began 
                to thump heavily in his chest while he looked. Under his bed, around the room, inside the duvet, on the floor. Timothy was 
                gone. 
               </p>
               <p>
                He sprinted out his room and went to find his mom and dad in the kitchen having their coffee. “Have you seen Timothy 
                anywhere?” His voice cracked as he tried to not sound as nervous as he felt. His dad looked at him, a solid wrinkle 
                forming on his brow, and his mom sighed.
               </p>
               <p>
                “Dear, Timothy is gone. We threw him out last night while you were sleeping. You are too old to have toys now. You are 
                13 next week, what are all your friends going to think?” His mom said in a matter of fact tone. As if she didn’t even 
                think twice about what she had done.
               </p>
               <p>
                His heart, now barley beating, fell into his stomach. A hard lump weighing him down as if it were trying to pull his 
                body into the ground. He couldn’t say anything, he couldn’t explain to them what they had done because he knew they 
                would never understand. They got rid of his best friend. He ran to the front of the house, opening the gate. He heard 
                his dads hoarse voice call for him to come back. But he still had hope. Maybe Timothy was still out with the rest of the 
                trash maybe he could save him.  He rushed to their dustbin and flung open the lid. The putrid smell raked his nostrils as 
                he looked inside but it was empty. Just sticky sludge pooling at the bottom of the bin. No Timothy to be found. He was 
                gone, and all that he had to remember him by was the rotting smell of the dustbin.

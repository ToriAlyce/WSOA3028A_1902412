                Hi, my name is Charlette Salloue. I am 19 years old and I feel like a living contradiction. 
                My natural personality is very upbeat and positive, but for some reason I also have a very cynical 
                side. This side of me is negative, so it has always been somewhat confusing to me as I normally am 
                quite positive. In order to deal with this, I have named my cynical side Alijah who I like to think 
                of as a 38-year-old very grumpy English man. I am an aspiring writer and often I channel into Alijah 
                when writing and often end up creating two stories with very different perspectives.  I hope you enjoy 
                my stories as much as I enjoy sharing them.
            </p>

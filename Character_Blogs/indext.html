            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, my name is Charlette Salloue. I am 24 years old, 
                living in South Africa and I feel like a living contradiction. 
                My natural personality is very upbeat and positive, but for 
                some reason I also have a very cynical side. This side of me 
                is negative, so it has always been somewhat confusing to me 
                as I normally am quite positive. In order to deal with this, 
                I have named my cynical side Alijah who I like to think of as 
                a 38-year-old very grumpy English man. I am an aspiring writer 
                and often I channel into Alijah when writing and often end up 
                creating two stories with very different perspectives. Or even 
                a very inspired creative work. Since this is how I write, 
                I sign my writer’s names as “Charlette Alijah”. I hope you enjoy 
                my stories as much as I enjoy sharing them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been living in South Africa, (my whole life). I 
                love my country and its deep varieties of culture. I 
                recently have inherited a small secondhand book shop; 
                I feel that it fits me as a writer to be among the things 
                I love. I must get the book shop up and running on my own 
                and hope to make it a safe space for people who want to 
                come and read and learn. I am determined to make it amazing!!
            </p>
            <p>
                Anywho… I tend to take on too much at a time so hopefully I 
                can handle this and take you, my readers, along for the ride!
            </p>

             <h3>Establishing My Writing</h3>
             <section>
               <p>
                For the past couple days, as I really look and explore aspects of my country around me, I get inspired by such little 
                things that I can bring into my writing. Writing many short stories is what I enjoy most, I have yet to even think of 
                a grand idea for a novel, but this practice that I am doing is really allowing for my writing to change and grow into 
                something new. 
               </p>
               <p>
                Working with both sides of myself, I really enjoy creating two contrasting or interleading stories. Stories that are as 
                diverse from each other like the people here in South Africa. As I write in my original style, I find the stories being 
                hopeful, imaginative, and trying to portray the beauty in a harsh world. Yet when I focus on my darker side, and Alijah 
                comes into my work, my stories are more cynical, sad and focus on harsh realities in contrast to the beautiful moments in 
                life. As I practice and release my writing into the world trying to take one situation or inspiration and create two 
                different sides of it, it really allows me to show how nothing is ever clear and strait forward - no two peopleâ€™s stories 
                are the same. That is what I am trying to do as a writer, and though you may think my next few stories are contradicting 
                or confusing, try see why each are necessary to the story. I hope you enjoy them.

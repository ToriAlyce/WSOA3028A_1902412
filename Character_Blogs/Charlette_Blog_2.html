                What I love about South Africa is the amount of inspiration and creativity of South African people. 
                The other day I was walking to the shops, down the road from my house. There was a man selling theses amazing 
                wooden carved sculptures on the side of the road. Which is common to see across South Africa, as many people 
                make their lively hood this way, by selling beautiful beaded, wooden sculptures and toys. I found his sculptures 
                so beautiful and had to buy one!

                This led to such a huge inspiration for me of the character of this sculpture, that I wrote a piece about him. 
                Home you enjoy the story of the wooden wizards past. 
                <blockquote>
                    Hoarse murmurs of incomprehensible words filtered through the air as the mage worked, his back arched tensely, 
                    showing the jagged bones of his spine sharp, like mountain peaks. Although you could not see his cloaked figure fully, 
                    it was apparent how immensely thin he was, as though his brittle bones were about to crumble into sawdust, concealed in 
                    a layer of spider-web thin skin. The moistened emerald green robes draped over him, head to toe in thick layers, appeared 
                    as shimmering molten goo, slowly dissolving his body in a lake of fabric, pooled around his feet. His moss green pointed 
                    hat welted over his head as if growing from his skull, was bent to the one side. Silver streams of grey fuzz cascaded 
                    down from it to his contorted back, ending at mid-waist, bits caught in the folds of his robes. The air was brimming 
                    with a smothering tension as he worked in desperation, shoulders trembling, as though his body barely had the strength 
                    to hold him any longer, his legs quaked. Every fibre of his being was straining, as he jerked with harsh sporadic movements.

                <blockquote>
                    His brow furrowed in deep concentration as he worked his wrinkles overlapping his droopy plum bruised eyes, eyes that are a 
                    lifeless steely grey. He gripped his wand desperately, turning it slowly in counter-clockwise circles as it was his last hope.
                     The skin on his hands appeared transparent, showing the deterioration of his insides was pulled taught, his needle-like 
                     fingers poised as he whisked his wand about in a blur as his chanting grew. Hot clouds of thick red smoke began to fill the 
                     air. It seeped through his beard, a mass of matted wire bristling through his liver-spotted skin.

                <blockquote>
                    Looming over the cauldron in front of him he slowly dipped the end of his wand into the murky mixture. Golden streams 
                    began to spiral over his wand till they reached the tips of his frail fingers bursting into bright rays of light filling 
                    the room. The layers of old skin began to wither and flitter to the ground like pieces of shredded paper, his pale skin 
                    becoming smooth but raw as thick veins began to protrude as they filled with sticky red blood and crept over his body 
                    giving his new skin a blushed pink colour. He began to straighten, screaming in agony, while his bones started to reform 
                    sounding like the crashing of falling hail. The hanging cloak over his body, once saggy, began to tighten and fit of every 
                    inch of his figure as though it was becoming a second skin, moulding into his shape as new muscles began to grow out of 
                    nothing thickening his exterior. 
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    The dull frost of his eyes began to melt away as the honey colour began to soak into his iris. His breath now raspy as he 
                    gasped for air that smelt of burning flesh and rotting matter as he began to slowly rise. Now the only crooked aspect of 
                    his body would be the upturned smile that played on the edges of his lips.

                I like to think that this sculpture was created based off a strong and powerful wizard. Its amazing how someone’s 
                art piece and inspire another person so much. That’s the thing about living in South Africa there is so much beauty here.

                    Awe my bras, the names Aaron and here I’m gonna give u the lowdown about all my experiences being a street kid. 
                    Well they call us street kids, but I like to think of us as street survivors, we don’t need no grownups looking 
                    after us, we can handle ourselves bra! I’m goanna show u guys how u don’t need to go into the foster system and 
                    how you can be living large on the streets of Joburg, like a king bra! Ima give tips and tricks that I use to 
                    survive on the streets of Jb, I’m sure u will all find them useful. I’m giving u the independence u need my bras!

                    U probably wondering why I’m a street survivor in the first place. My dad and I were both homeless, but the man 
                    raised me well and taught me what I need to survive. I still have the most respect for the bra, he showed me that 
                    my background does not determine who I am. He got killed in a hit n run, still gotta find who did it. But I’m 17 
                    and I don’t need no foster home, I’m gonna be 18 soon anyway. I don’t need no one. So that’s why I’m here my bras, 
                    I’m here to help u like my dad helped me. We are survivors my bra!

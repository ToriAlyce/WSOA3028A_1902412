                So, get ready to read up on some of my challenges, code trials 
                and interesting things I’m going to be learning. I hope you find

             <h3>Today i learned some spice internet history.</h3>
             <p>So, allow me to take you on a roller-coaster that is the browser wars. 
                 In the 1990's the web was a mess and extremely hard to navigate. 
                 But a group of students in the University of Illinois planned to change 
                 that for everyone. They created Mosaic, the building blocks of the first 
                 ever internet browser. Unfortunately, since they used the University of 
                 Illinois resources to build Mosaic the university owned the whole project. 
                 Therefore, the students once graduated, made a bran new company built off 
                 the original ideas of Mosaic. However, they were not allowed to use any of 
                 the old work that had done on Mosaic but rather start again from scratch in 
                 order to make the Netscape browser.  Mosaic was the practice run before the 
                 real show started. So, like that the browser was born! It was easily accessible, 
                 great to navigate and opened whole new world for the user.</br> This was new and 
                 profitable technology, and a big fish in the pond wanted a slice of the 
                 action - Microsoft came out with Internet Explorer. This browser was not only new 
                 competition for Netscape, was also built off the Mosaic original source code. 
                 Since the University of Illinois owned the rights to Mosaic, Microsoft approached 
                 them and bought the source code so they could try and compete against Netscape to 
                 be the best browser.  Internet explorer was built into Windows operating system, 
                 allowing anyone with windows to by default have the Internet explorer 
                 browser - taking Netscape down. In the end Microsoft ruined Netscape but Netscape
                  didn’t let them off that easily, releasing their source code to the world, 
                  allowing for many more browsers to rise and compete against Internet Explorer. 
                  One of which being google Chrome, that became the worlds top browser in 2015.</p>

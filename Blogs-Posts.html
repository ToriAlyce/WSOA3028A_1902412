            <h3>Hi everyone!</h3>
            <p>Hi, and welcome to my blog! I’m an interactive media student 
                at WITS University. Here I’m going to be blogging about all 
                the interesting and new things I learn well learning web design. 
                So, get ready to read up on some of my challenges, code trials 
                and interesting things I’m going to be learning. I hope you find 
                them as interesting as I do!</p>

             <h3>Today i learned some spice internet history.</h3>
             <p>So, allow me to take you on a roller-coaster that is the browser wars. 
                 In the 1990's the web was a mess and extremely hard to navigate. 
                 But a group of students in the University of Illinois planned to change 
                 that for everyone. They created Mosaic, the building blocks of the first 
                 ever internet browser. Unfortunately, since they used the University of 
                 Illinois resources to build Mosaic the university owned the whole project. 
                 Therefore, the students once graduated, made a bran new company built off 
                 the original ideas of Mosaic. However, they were not allowed to use any of 
                 the old work that had done on Mosaic but rather start again from scratch in 
                 order to make the Netscape browser.  Mosaic was the practice run before the 
                 real show started. So, like that the browser was born! It was easily accessible, 
                 great to navigate and opened whole new world for the user.</br> This was new and 
                 profitable technology, and a big fish in the pond wanted a slice of the 
                 action - Microsoft came out with Internet Explorer. This browser was not only new 
                 competition for Netscape, was also built off the Mosaic original source code. 
                 Since the University of Illinois owned the rights to Mosaic, Microsoft approached 
                 them and bought the source code so they could try and compete against Netscape to 
                 be the best browser.  Internet explorer was built into Windows operating system, 
                 allowing anyone with windows to by default have the Internet explorer 
                 browser - taking Netscape down. In the end Microsoft ruined Netscape but Netscape
                  didn’t let them off that easily, releasing their source code to the world, 
                  allowing for many more browsers to rise and compete against Internet Explorer. 
                  One of which being google Chrome, that became the worlds top browser in 2015.</p>

             <h3>Semantics are the reson you can view this page!</h3>
             <p>
                So today we started learning about Semantic Mark ups, and what these basically are the 
                key words used in HTML code in order to divide parts of a webpage into visible sections. 
                For example, you have Headers, body, navs and many others. These basically allow the web 
                developer to organize their code and divide it into many sections and overall improving 
                their structure. The reason that semantic mark up is so important and must be used appropriately is that 
                when a webpage is being worked on by a group of designers, that everyone will understand 
                the structure and sectioning and the workflow will go a lot smoother.
            </br>
                So how this webpage works is that I have made use of semantic mark up in order to design this 
                page, this also allows for my sectioning and everything to make more sense so that if I need 
                to go back and change everything I will be able to fix certain aspects without influencing others.
